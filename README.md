## Contents

### lib
This folders contains all the basic functions to use the 2D KS.

### kuramoto_dns.m
Simple example of direct numerical simulation (DNS) of the modified KS equation. To advance in time the function `ks_timestep` is used.

### kuramoto_statespace.m
Simple example of state-space formulation for the KS equation via the matrices A,B,C,D. The KS equation is marched in time as a standard LTI system.

### kuramoto_optimalcontrol.m
Example of optimal control via Riccati equation (LQR) as well as adjoint-based optimisation.
